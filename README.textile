h2. Ride The FireEagle

This is a Rails plugin that easily integrates your app with "Fire Eagle":http://fireeagle.com/

For now, it only covers the ActiveRecord side of things. Full support for handling the entire authentication flow coming soon.

h3. Install

# @gem install fireeagle@
# @./script/generate ride_the_fireeagle User@
# @rake db:migrate@
# @mate config/fireeagle.yml@, add your FireEagle application info
# Add @ride_the_fireeagle@ to @/app/models/user.rb@

h3. Usage

Once that's all done, your instances of @User@ have some fun new methods:

<pre>
>> @user = User.create(:login => 'alice')
>> @user.authorized_with_fireeagle?
=> false
</pre>

So, this user hasn't linked their account to Fire Eagle yet. Send them to an action that does the following:

<pre>
  def activate_fireeagle
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
    @user.get_fireeagle_request_token
    redirect_to @user.fireeagle_authorization_url
  end
</pre>

Now you wait for the user to authorize. When they authorize, Fire Eagle will invoke your application callback URL with the request token appended as parameters.

<pre>
  def fireeagle_callback
    @user = User.find_by_fireeagle_request_token(params[:oauth_token])
    @user.authorize_with_fireeagle
  end
</pre>

Now that user is authorized with Fire Eagle!

<pre>
>> @user = User.find_by_login('alice')
>> @user.authorized_with_fireeagle?
=> true
</pre>

You can now update and query that user's location, assuming the User gave you those permissions when authorizing.

<pre>
>> @user = User.find_by_login('alice')
>> @user.update_location(:q => "Atlanta, GA")
>> @user.location.name
=> "Atlanta, GA"
</pre>

More information about the acceptable parameters for updating a User's location is available in the RDoc for "FireEagle::Client#update":http://fireeagle.rubyforge.org/classes/FireEagle/Client.html

More information about 'location' response is available in the RDoc for "FireEagle::Location":http://fireeagle.rubyforge.org/classes/FireEagle/Location.html. The 'best guess' location is currently automatically selected and returned.
